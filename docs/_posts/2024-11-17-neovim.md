So I installed Neovim and set it up easy via LazyVim. This is especially useful and is a very quick start.
The keyboard binds are still a bit annoying, but I'm sure I'll find them OK later on. On this Chromebook
I made a `.bashrc` entry to make `v` launch `nvim` in `st` as it supports nerd fonts.

So far so good. To find the binding for open new? Maybe `:e <file>`? It's likely. All the LSP services
are kind of running, but some are "awaiting" a version upgrade beyond this default Debian. I'm not missing
anything critical, and this is even way faster than VSCode.

Ah, some spell checking with `[s` and `]s` with `zG` for global accept for user. I like the little things
like the space leader key. I've already found faster buffer switching with `<space>fb`, although `i`
and `<esc>` are going to irritate my brain for some time.
