So I bound `rofi` to `M-r` in Emacs, and it's a nice fast tool. I put a config in `extras-backup` and even added a simple C "script" plugin to get started. It uses shell system calls to achieve the interface to `rofi`, but is designed to allow easy adapting C code producing standard out "exit messages". So yes, I like it, but not having to attach a key bind to any particular window manager (at present), simplifies things.

I've look into distrobox, and it seems quite interesting to "replace" docker with simpler "pods". I'm not sure it will replace the much lighter "Nix Package Manager", but some of the ease of just using any specific distro looks really good for a workflow.

I've upgraded to BETA Mint Linux 22 Wilma. A few minor issues in the upgrades to packages, but not unexpected. It all work headless as an upgrade via `ssh`, and so I was impressed at that. Haven't really used the GUI mutch beyond the initial install before the upgrade. I support the move to hold some apps at Gtk3, and would prefer more cross compatibility of apps to be able to export theme elements in some standard way.

I themed `rofi` and Emacs to a `gruvbox-dark` variant. I can't really tell much difference between soft to hard on the theme, but I suppose there must be. So yes, I'm quite happy with system progress. Don't mention the election.
