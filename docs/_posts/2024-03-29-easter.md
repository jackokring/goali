## Easter
Found a nice few libraies for use later for postgreSQL and the standard keyring service. Started putting together some unit testing. Refactoring code to make expansion easier in rrrrelation to debug and future growth.

Great. Now to obtain the wine. This tap water's not going to convert itself. I don't if Thames Water are considering refactoring out "Thames Shit" to sell that oh, so profitable future hard water kidney stone.
