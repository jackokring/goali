## Simplified Vocabularies and Grammar
So the action space starts with user input (pick, drop, use held, use placed, inventory, sort, etc.), and becomes more abstract as those actions implement higher abstractions. Objects follow a named to importance property grouping, so the adjectives (or literal known names of the "people") follow a virtual dispatch verb/adverb based on the object arguments.

The rest of the language should form a kind of modal logic system with some "pointer/handle" reference abilities. This should be extendable not to consciousness, but to model representation of the model container and its actions within the model, as a weighted loss function. 

## Umm ...
Speech should be easy as piping words into `espeak-ng` with perhaps a pronouncement exception list (not Spanish).
