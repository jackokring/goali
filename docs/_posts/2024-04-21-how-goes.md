## Security of VSCode
Have I talked about the `/proc/self/exe` security issue today? The one where you just slap a bunch of arguments on the end to flood out the line length of top and so pretend a process is vscode or something, and hide the execution requirement in a uuid? You can tell the `exe` kind of gives a hint away down some being played rabbit hole.

## So do you Think vscode is Copying Spyware (2024-04-23)?
Likely what happened is something like copilot made up some stuff which sort of worked. Updates of the extensions seems to have fixed the issues of a grinding halt and general slowness. But imagine if everybody's common AI all (is there just one?)suggested the same "hiding the executable" behind the `/proc` (why is the execute bit even set?) and hallucinated some command arguments looking the part of something as it's supposed to be. That's going to be a `sudo killall exe` nightmare for mitigation of the "problem".

## `null /proc | which /proc`
It doesn't make sense, and yes it would be easy to proxy if the execute bit wasn't set, but what exactly was the rationale for adding the `/proc/self/exe` file to the `/proc` system? I'm sure any `C` code could do any reference to any of those bytes (`nano /proc/self/exe`) without such a feature.
