So I managed to get `dwm` to "boot" as the remote window manager (`$PATH` issues and right file to use). After fiddling for a while, and realizing Emacs can do `ESC` prefix entry of `M-`, I will go back to the default of DWM using the alt key. It's less of a finger twiddle. I'll leave the super key alone for now. I might add in a few hot keys for the browser, Emacs, and some other quick to access essentials. I must investigate the source code to select tag 1. It appears not to work for me, but might be super key related at the moment.

## ST the Terminal

Had a brief look at the source, and wondered why someone would ever build a buffer forever protocol into terminal specifications. You know, in the same way base 64 encoding is perhaps not as useful for me as imagined. I might go over the source again later. Could be something to play with in terms of a Unicode display grid.

## SLSTATUS the Infomation Tool

Seems easy enough to read the source. The module interface seems easy enough to copy if there's something I wish to add. So now back to some edits.
