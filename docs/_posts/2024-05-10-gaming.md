## Added Some `emacs` Config
Just a compile test of the latest emacs at present, but VSCode is getting a little irritating to be used in production.

## Been Thinking about Gaming
Ah, yes a space game of the adventure type with perhaps some mild action increase in the interaction game phase.

Maybe I should also look into WASM? or some generic machine to run the adventure. Sure, it's been done before, but should be fun doing it again. Compressed maps, object grammars (NLP), a small amount of pixel or SVG art?

I wonder if some kind of constrained chatAPI query would be good for building some automatic scenario making, although it would have to have some kind of connection to the coordinate based object system. I mean what does it mean to be placed in the platonic reality coordinate system as a document to a fact?
