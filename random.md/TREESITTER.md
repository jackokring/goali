# An AST Parser for Emacs

I'm not sure if it will actually do anything for me, or if it's a way of introducing a sinister `node.js` dependency in Emacs. Maybe some languages are more complex and in need of such AST parsing to get a good display. Only time will tell.

## Adding in the Config

Seems the config doesn't error out if there hasn't been installed a `*-ts-mode` so that's good. Well this versionm of Emacs is pre-tree-sitter.
