# Modifier Keys

## Shift

The first modifier. It increased the range of punctuation available as well as allowing letter cases. And this was sort of considered good, being the first step in keyboard WYSIWYG.

## Control

The automation modifier. Text had to be mixed with control of the electronic device. It wasn't a key to glpyh arrangement all the time. So in the practical mind set 32 control charaters were set in ASCII. This make control with letters, a few symbols and the question mark the obvious first choice for an action command keybind. In the context of origins, using a shift combination with control had no meaning due to no means of transmission to the application. In a sense an easy implementation would have just masked off bits as zero to obtain control codes to put over the wire. As shift would have masked bits to one to or zero to achive its purpose, the combination of control with shift could be seen as indeterminate. An ideal later candidate for device control of the terminal, and not control of the applacation shown in the terminal. This likely explains control shift V.

## Alt

The character set modifier. Symbols and things, and all things that could be imagined. Implemented as a control escape sequence when sent to applications, as a prefix code a combination with shift was allowed, and with control too. Some control codes at this stage gained their own key, just like some which had had their own key since before some keyboards were given a control. Control M had always been the long need to do first carraige return, before the much shorter in time line feed. Motors and their spin up times. I suppose as the alt sequencing made a control code escape sequence, it maybe didn't matter about any kind of priority or preference between alt with control, or alt with shift, although more alt shift possibilities of validity would exist without more complex control escape sequence encodings. More controlly but less control combinations? I suppose the local device could have all the alt with control and shift combinations, kind of exceptions too numerous to tie up all the kilobytes of time share mainframe memory.

## Alt Gr and Right Control

Some keyboards introduced the 3rd level modifier to do all the strange character as the electronic computer spread from an English language background. In some applications even the right control greater gained a hypervisor role. And Unicode, and compose key, and ...

## Super, Windows and Everything

The final modifier. Not enough two finger combinations? A special key for the system growing within the electronics of the local terminal? The local terminal just becomming a local application within a whole "local display network" of multitasking application possibilities. It wouldn't then be an application key, but more of a system possibility hot key to schedule applications. The only "application" that should bind to (or more exactly be launched by being bound by the OS "application") is all OS.

Ah, clicky, click click ...
