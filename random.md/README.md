# Welcome to Random Markdown

Is it really connected to [The Wiki](https://github.com/jackokring/goali/wiki)? Who knows? Is it [The Blog](https://jackokring.github.io/goali/)? I don't think it is. I suppose the blog is like a promotional kind of page with styling and a bit of keyword indexing. The wiki is more informal and is supposed to be like a wikipedia of the whole github repo. Other people can add to the wiki sometimes if it is so enabled.

Strangely, the wiki is not part of the repo download pull, but the blog is. So that makes Random Markdown like an offline set of textual information, without template styling or wiki searching. The wiki can't be edited offline unlike the blog and Random Markdown can. It's a magical information triad. So what am I going to be putting here? Timeless classics? Ah, we shall see.
